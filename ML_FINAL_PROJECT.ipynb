Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared data for training by handling missing values and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized rainfall patterns across subdivisions and seasons to understand trends and correlations.
Model Training and Testing: Built and evaluated models using regression techniques for optimal performance.
Web Application: Integrated the model into a Flask application, allowing users to input subdivision and year to predict rainfall.
Use Cases:
Disaster management (e.g., flood risk prediction).
Agricultural planning (e.g., irrigation scheduling).
Water resource management (e.g., reservoir planning).
Future Scope
Incorporate recent data and additional climate features (e.g., temperature, humidity) for improved accuracy.
Extend predictions to city-level granularity.
Develop features to predict extreme weather events like droughts or storms.
